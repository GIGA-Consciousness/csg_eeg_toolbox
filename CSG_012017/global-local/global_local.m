%% The global-local paradigm

% Created by Renate Rutiku; last tested December 9th, 2016
% The GenerateTone function is from another source, but cannot find it anymore

% Most parameters are replicated from Faugeras et al. (2012)

% Stimuli: 
% - chords of 3 sinusoids (either 350, 700, and 1400 Hz; or 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz)
% - second and third partials are of 1/2 and 1/4 intensity, respectively
% - duration 50 ms (including 7 ms rise and fall times)
% - presented in series of 5 with 150 ms SOA between sounds
% - series are separated by a variable interval of 1350 to 1650 ms (50-ms steps)

% Conditions:
% - the standard is either a series of the same 5 sounds (AAAAA or BBBBB) or of the final sound swapped (either AAAAB or BBBBA)
% - the deviants' 5th sound is opposite to their respective standard's 5th sound

% Blocks:
% - each block consists of 80% standards and 20% deviants
% - the number of deviants varies randomly between 22 and 30
% - all deviants are separated by at least 2 standards
% - each block starts with 20 â€“30 standards

% Sequence:
% - each of the 4 possible block types is presented twice
% - the blocks are presented in in a fixed order (two runs of AAAAA, BBBBB, AAAAB, BBBBA global standards)
