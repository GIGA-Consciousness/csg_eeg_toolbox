In place of the expected mex file this placeholder file was executed:

  Screen

This mex file seems to be missing or inaccessible on your Matlab path or it is dysfunctional:

  Screen.mexw64

It is important that the folder which contains the Screen mex file is located *before*
the PsychBasic folder on your Matlab path.
On Matlab V7.4 (R2007a) or later versions, the folder
C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox\Psychtoolbox-3-Psychtoolbox-3-1ed2856\Psychtoolbox\PsychBasic\MatlabWindowsFilesR2007a\ must be before the folder
C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox\Psychtoolbox-3-Psychtoolbox-3-1ed2856\Psychtoolbox\PsychBasic\ 

type path to display the current path and check for this condition.
If the order is wrong, simply cd into your Psychtoolbox root folder
C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox\Psychtoolbox-3-Psychtoolbox-3-1ed2856\Psychtoolbox\ and then run SetupPsychtoolbox again.
That is the simplest way of fixing such path problems - Or to get more diagnostic output.

Another reason could be insufficient access permissions or 
some missing 3rd party libraries on your system.

On Microsoft Windows with supported Matlab versions (>= V7.4) it could also be that
the required Visual C++ 2010 runtime libraries are missing on your system.
The Psychtoolbox/PsychContributed/ subfolder contains installer files for them, which
you can execute after quitting Matlab. The name of the file is vcredist_x64.exe
if system_dependent('IsDebugMode')==1, dbstep; end
if system_dependent('IsDebugMode')==1, dbstep; end



A very simple test call to the Screen() MEX file failed in AssertOpenGL, indicating
if system_dependent('IsDebugMode')==1, dbstep; end
that either Screen is totally dysfunctional, or you are trying to run your script on
if system_dependent('IsDebugMode')==1, dbstep; end
a system without Psychtoolbox-3 properly installed - or not installed at all.

if system_dependent('IsDebugMode')==1, dbquit; end
help randi
  i=Randi(n,[dims])
  Returns a random integer sample from 1:n. The optional second argument
  may be used to specify the size of the returned array of independent
  samples. E.g. randi(100,[3,3]) returns a 3x3 array of independent samples
  drawn from the range 1:100. Also see RAND, RANDN, RandSample, Sample, and
  Shuffle.
  
  We assume that n is a positive integer, and rely on the fact that RAND
  never returns 0 or 1.
  
  Randi(n) is similar to David Brainard's Ranint(n).

Good. Your privileges suffice for the requested installation into folder C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox.

Hmm. You already have an old Psychtoolbox folder:
C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox\Psychtoolbox-3-Psychtoolbox-3-1ed2856\Psychtoolbox
That old Psychtoolbox should be removed before we install a new one.
First we remove all references to "Psychtoolbox" from the MATLAB / OCTAVE path.
Success.
Shall I delete the old Psychtoolbox folder and all its contents 
(recommended in most cases), (yes or no)? yes
Now we delete "Psychtoolbox" itself.
Success.

I will now download the latest Psychtoolbox for Windows.
Requested flavor is: beta
Target folder for installation: C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox
The following CHECKOUT command asks the Subversion client to 
download the Psychtoolbox:
svn checkout  https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/branches/beta/Psychtoolbox/ "C:\Users\Doro\Github\EEGtoolswc\branches\brancheDC\FASST\CSG\Psychotoolbox\Psychtoolbox"
Downloading. It's nearly 100 MB, which can take many minutes. 
Alas there may be no output to this window to indicate progress until the download is complete. 
Please be patient ...
If you see some message asking something like "accept certificate (p)ermanently, (t)emporarily? etc."
then please press the p key on your keyboard, possibly followed by pressing the ENTER key.

'svn' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
operable program or batch file. 
Sorry, the download command "CHECKOUT" failed with error code 1: 
'svn' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

The download failure might be due to temporary network or server problems. You may want to try again in a
few minutes. It could also be that the subversion client was not (properly) installed. On Microsoft
Windows you will need to exit and restart Matlab or Octave after installation of the Subversion client. If that
does not help, you will need to reboot your machine before proceeding.
Another reason for download failure could be if an old working copy - a Psychtoolbox folder - still exists.
In that case, it may help to manually delete that folder. Or maybe you do not have write permissions for the target folder?
